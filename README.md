## Files
*All files have comments with further explanations on what each function does. Refer to the files to learn more.*

1) vibrio_cholerae.py : The main file with many of the early concepts of bioinformatics analysis using programming. 
The file name refers to Vibrio Cholerae because I tested many of these functions with the vibrio cholerae genome and its DnaA box.
Functions are mainly focused on the Central Dogma (DNA -> mRNA -> Protein) and steps involved in its processes, as well as identifying key features.
    - e_coli_ori_C.py : Uses functions written in the vibrio_cholerae.py file in order to locate the ori of E.Coli genome by calculating and visualizing the loss of Cytosine in the lagging strand.
    - e_coli_ori_GC.py: Similarly to the last file, this uses functions imported from vibrio_cholerae to locate the ori of E.Coli. This time, by the varying difference between the number of Guanine and Cytosine pairs.
    - thermotoga_petrophilia.py : Practices the analysis of vibrio cholerae genome on a different bacteria, the Thermotoga Petrophilia genome.
  
2) motifs.py : The second main file with more functions used in bioinformatics. The file is mainly focused on motif and pattern identification, that allows bioinformaticians to quantitatively 
assess the value of a certain motif or series of DNA sequences.
    - DosR.py : Using the functions built into motifs.py in order to analyze the Dormancy Survival Regulator gene existent in Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Bascterium.
    - random_motfs.py : File that builds off of the functions used in motifs.py. It implements randomness into the motif-identifying process in order to remove certain restrictions with the functions in motifs.py

3) All txt files are used in their respective python files in order to read the genome for analysis.

## Overview
Bioinformatics concepts is a Python project I initiated in order to learn and practice the concepts of Bioinformatics, a field that mixes my background with my newfound passions.
I come from a Biochemistry background from UCSD, and have a self-taught passion for working with programming languages and data analytics.
I came upon the field of bioinformatics during my last year at UCSD, and it immediately grabbed my attention. 
It was a field that combined my love for biochemistry research/science, and my passion for learning languages like Python and SQL.
As I have been interested in developing Python skills, this was an opportunity to develop my skills further. 

This project was a great learning experience for me, where I could really gain hands-on understanding of how modern day programming can enhance the analysis of scientific research.
Research and science never ends, so I hope to keep learning and growing, both in my biochemistry knowledge, and my programming technical skills!
